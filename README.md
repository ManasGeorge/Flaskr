Following along with the Flaskr tutorial [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/).
Basic forum app with a single user account. Need to add multiple accounts, wrap text, add images. This project will be my launchpad for further investigations into Flaskr. 

Usage

The following command should run the app on port 5000, localhost.
